## 📘 About This Repository

This folder contains **detailed, conceptual notes** about React — each file aims to explain a concept **as clearly as possible**.  
Think of it as a **React cheat sheet**, continuously evolving as I learn more.

Each note uses the **TL;DR format**, covering:
- 🔹 What it is  
- 🔹 Why it matters  
- 🔹 Key syntax/code snippet
